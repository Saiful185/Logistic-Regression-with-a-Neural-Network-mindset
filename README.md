## Logistic-Regression-with-a-Neural-Network-mindset

This is an Assignment from the 1st course of Deep Learning Specialization. In this assignment we perform image recognition using logistic regression. The learning objective was..
Building the general architecture of a learning algorithm, including:
1. Initializing parameters
2. Calculating the cost function and its gradient
3. Using an optimization algorithm (gradient descent).
 
Finally, Gathering all three functions above into a main model function, in the right order.
